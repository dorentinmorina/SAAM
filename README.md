## Description of the project
This project aims to implement some climate aware asset management concepts seen in class. The first part of the project consists in building a portfolio based on the mean-variance
criterion. The second part focuses on the climate dimension of the portfolio with carbon emission reduction constraints, including a Net-Zero objective.
